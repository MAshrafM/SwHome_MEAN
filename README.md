# SW Home  
A MEAN Project using for the backend/server side: Mongo/Mongoose, Express v.4 and Node and Angular v.6 for client side. Switch/exchange homes to motivate traveling.  
  
The Project to reactivate the full-stack process after a series of only frontend projects + learning to unit test in the backend/server side APIs using Mocha and Chai.  
Server side built with express/node.js and Mongo/Mongoose for the db.  
Client Side Angular 6 with custom SCSS styles with Bootstrap, no testing in the front end + couple of bugs to be addressed in the future + more feature to be implemented.  

## Future  
- More security on the backside.
- Better cookie handling.  
- Add reviews on client side.  
- Better designs for forms.  
- Better UX with Matches and Connections.  
- User Profiles.  
- Test Front End.
